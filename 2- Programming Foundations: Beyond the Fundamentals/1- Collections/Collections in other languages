In python collections ,for example list, lets you to store in data type
    list = [
        "Mu",
        454, 
        True
    ]
but in some languages like C++ the data in a collection must have the same data type and
there isn't combination of data types

Also in python there are mutable collects like ,lists and dictionaries, and immutable
collection like ,tuple, that when you crate it you can not change it
